The MNIST dataset is one of the most fundamental databases used for artificial intelligence programming, as I'm sure many people know. There are several models that are used to accurately make predictions for the 10,000 test images, among them being the K-Nearest Neighborhood algorithm. The KNN model, while accurate, has a significant drawback, which is its speed. Oftentimes when people run a KNN program, it can take up to an hour to run. However, with this project, I've found a way to decrease the runtime significantly. It's possible to speed up the program runtime by compressing the dataset. This is done through multiplying all of the datasets by a matrix. Once the data is compressed, it'll run significantly quicker while maintaining a high accuracy.
